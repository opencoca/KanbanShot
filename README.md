# KanbanShot

Kanban's work management system is designed to help you visualize your work, limit work in progress, and maximize efficiency, which we call flow.

Kanban is the Japanese word for visual signals. With so many of us working in services and technology, our work is frequently invisible or intangible. Kanban helps you visualize your jobs, to understand them better, show these to others, and keep everyone on the same page.
